# DiffusionCoefficientByMaximumLikelihood
Maximum likelihood based estimation of diffusion coefficient

01. Run the script Main.m in Matlab.
02. Define basic parameters of the measured trajectories.

03. Choose directory for the trajectories.

The script read the directories recursively. Keep your trajectories in a logical directory structure. For example:

04. When the analysis completed, you will be informed.

05. The output file contains the following:
 - The name of trajectory
 - The length of trajectory (in frames)
 - The diffusion coefficient (um^2/s) calculated by Maximum likelihood method
 - The localization error (nm) extracted by  by Maximum likelihood method
 - The diffusion coefficient (um^2/s) calculated by MSD method
 - The y-intercept (nm^2) Provided by MSD method
 - The crawled area (um^2, convex hull) 
 - The maximal distance (um)
 
The output files (Results_output.txt) are saved in each directory.
